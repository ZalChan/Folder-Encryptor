# Folder-Encryptor
A simple tool that isn't secure whatsoever, but allows you to have protection over your not so tech savvy friends.
(tested on linux)
<h4><strong>Pre-requisites</strong></h4>
access to libraries:
<ul>
  <li>dirent.h </li>
  <li>fstream" </li>
</ul>
but to my knowledge they are both cross platform. 
<h4><strong>How to run</strong></h4>
<ol>
  <li>open up terminal and find the directory</li>
  <li>open up FolderEncryptor.cpp</li>
  <li>where it says FolderName at the top type in the path to your Folder</li>
  <li>go back to the terminal</li>
  <li>run with ./FolderEncryptor e to encrypt or ./FolderEncryptor d to decrypt</li>
  <li>You're done! </li>
 </ol>
  Quick note: status.txt shows you the state the folder is in, if it's encrypted or decrypted
